Inner join : -
An INNER JOIN is a type of JOIN operation in SQL that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column. It returns only the rows where there is a match 
between the columns of the specified tables. If there is no matching row in any of the tables, those rows will not be included in the result.

Outer Join : -
An OUTER JOIN is a type of JOIN operation in SQL that returns all the rows from one table and the matching rows from the other table(s). If there is no match for a row
in one of the tables the result set will contain NULL values for columns coming from the table with no match.

Left inner join:-
its a combination of a LEFT JOIN and an INNER JOIN. It behaves like a LEFT JOIN retrieving all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.
However unlike a regular LEFT JOIN it only includes the rows where there is a match in the right table.

Right Outer join:-
A RIGHT OUTER JOIN, also known as a RIGHT JOIN or RIGHT OUTER JOIN is another type of JOIN operation in SQL. It works similarly to a LEFT OUTER JOIN
but the roles of the tables are reversed. In a RIGHT OUTER JOIN all the rows from the right table are included in the result set along with the matching rows 
from the left table based on the specified join condition. If there is no match for a row from the right table in the left table the result will contain NULL 
values for the columns of the left table
